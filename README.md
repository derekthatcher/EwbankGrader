# EwbankGrader
Find overall grade of sport climb by adding up the sections

This is a simple Ewbank version of the MASTERPEICE DarthGrader.

I did my own math using some set points from Darth, see: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/c3mshhgvzb

You can calibrate it yourself, by considering two climbs of the same grade added together with both 'No rest' and a 'Good rest' between them. For example: two 25s, "25 N 25" by default gives a 27.5 (a 27/28). You might think this deserves a 28 at a particular crag, so set N to be 3
